This is a cleaned version of the code used for my masters thesis project on Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning within the field of cloth manipulation

this repository holds:

The orignal code used for training Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning,

A PPO implementation used in conjunction with Adversarial Learning. 


The Github Repository code was implemented based on the following github repositories.

- Mujoco environment design
https://gitlab.sdu.dk/sdurobotics/teaching/mj_sim


- PPO inspired implementation 
https://github.com/reinforcement-learning-kr/lets-do-irl


- AIRL repo
https://github.com/toshikwa/gail-airl-ppo.pytorch




This repository also consists of expert demonstrations and MuJoCo environments for:

1 DOF - underactuated object manipulation

2 DOF - underactuated object manipulation

3 DOF - underactuated object manipulation

4 DOF - underactuated object manipulation
